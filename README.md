# Mult-Add Game: The Game of Multiplication and Addition

## About the Game

Mult-Add Game is a simple yet engaging math game designed to challenge your multiplication 
and addition skills. Inspired by the calculation exercises in the mobile app _Xiǎoyuán Kǒushuàn_
("小猿口算", i.e. XiaoYuan Quick Math), this game presents you with math problems in the form of 
"a * b + c" or "a * b".

## Game Features

- **Dynamic Questions**: The game generates random math problems, with a 70% chance of 
including an addend (+c or -c) to the multiplication result.
- **Scoring System**: Earn 1 point for each correct answer and see your score increase.
- **Feedback Mechanism**: After each answer, the previous correct answer is displayed, 
allowing you to track your progress.
- **Penalty for Incorrect Answers**: If you answer incorrectly without trying to correct
it, your input will be cleared, and the previous answer will be hidden as a small penalty 
to encourage focus and accuracy.
